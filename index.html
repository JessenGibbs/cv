I am a fouth year Software major at McGill Uuniversity. B
eyond my formal education I dedicate my time to learning
UX design as that is my passion. I have been the captain of
the Mcgill Varsity Rugby team for three years and been awarded
the RSEQ All-Star award for best outside-center in the league.
My technical projects include working on database refactoring,
UI design, and workflow optimization. During the COVID-19 pandemic
I pulled data from WHO, and many other datasources to model trends
and help share knowledge of the virus.
